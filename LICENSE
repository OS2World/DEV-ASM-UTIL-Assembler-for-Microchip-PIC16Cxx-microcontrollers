  This package (The picasm PIC assembler) can be freely distributed,
  in source or binary form, unmodified or modified, as long as
  the following conditions are met:

  1. All redistributions must include this license text and the original
     copyright notices and disclaimers.

  2. Modified versions must be clearly marked as such, and must not
     be misrepresented as being the original software.

  3. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of
     this package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of
     this package.  You may not charge a fee for this package itself.
     However, you may distribute this package in aggregate with other
     (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly
     commercial) software distribution provided that you do not
     advertise this package as a product of your own.

  a "reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the
  basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved
  and so on.  (You will not be required to justify it to the
  copyright holder, but only to the computing community at large
  as a market that must bear the fee)
